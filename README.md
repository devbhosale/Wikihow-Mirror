# This is not an official project and I claim no rights to any of the code
[Wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page) is a helpful, community-driven Wiki for how-to guides. In the spirit of communities coming together to collectively further human knowlege (or any old reason), they choose to release their source code as a tarball, linked to from `https://src.wikihow.com/`.

This is simply an automatic mirror of that weekly upload.

# What this repository is for
This repository is only meant to be an up-to-date mirror of the code presented in a way that's more accessible to developers than a tarball on an obscure page on their website. WikiHow affords their community with the [Right to Fork](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork), so you may fork from this repository to create your own Wikihow instance, or to play around with Wikimedia in general.

## Pull Requests, RFC, etc
Wikihow states in their source page:

> We are not accepting patches to the source code

So, basically this repository can be forked from or read. If you do submit a PR or an issue, I promise I'll read it out of curiosity only, but there's not much I can do with it (unless something process wise is wrong. Bad backup, typo in this README, etc)

# How often is this updated
If you're paranoid about the version of the source code you're getting, check the commit dates. This repository is automatically updated from a ZSH script running through cron. Any number of things could go wrong. My home computer could simply be off, they might change their link, the github push might fail, etc. Otherwise, everything is checked daily. There should realistlcally only be changes every week from Wikihow, though.

# What's your favorite desert?
Mine's lava cake, especially if peanut butter is incorporated somehow. If you want to, leave an issue with your favorite desert and we'll talk sweets.
